# GymBuddy

Got a little too loosy goosy with my workouts. No app felt right —
too bloated, too many upsells. So I built my own.

GymBuddy is a clean, Nike-inspired iOS training app built with SwiftUI
and SwiftData. No subscriptions. No noise. Just you and the gym.

## Features

- **Push / Pull / Legs** — pre-built PPL split, ready to go
- **Active Workout View** — current exercise front and center, full set tracking
- **Inline Rest Timer** — depleting bar with ±15s on-the-fly adjustments
- **Exercise List** — see what's coming, jump to any exercise mid-workout
- **Voice Coaching** — motivational cues via native TTS or ElevenLabs
- **Workout Summary** — volume recap after every session
- **Background Audio** — lockscreen controls, Now Playing integration
- **Dark mode first** — because gyms don't have natural lighting

---

## Stack

- Swift / SwiftUI
- SwiftData
- Observation framework (`@Observable`)
- AVFoundation + ElevenLabs API
- MediaPlayer (Now Playing / lockscreen)

## Design

Inspired by Nike's brutalist typography — black background, electric orange
accent, oversized bold type. Built to feel fast and serious.
